-- Read consistency guarantees a consistent view of the data at all times.
-- Changes made by one user do not conflict with the changes made by another user.
-- Read consistency ensures that, on the same data:
-- Readers do not wait for writers
-- Writers do not wait for readers
-- Writers wait for writers
-- The purpose of read consistency is to ensure that each user sees data as it existed at the last commit, before a DML operation started.
-- The same user can login as different sessions. Each session maintains read consistency in the manner described above, even if they are the same users.
